### About wifi based geolocation
Wi-Fi positioning system (WPS) or WiPS/WFPS is a geolocation system that uses the characteristics of nearby Wi-Fi hotspots and other wireless access points to discover where a device is located. It is used where satellite navigation such as GPS is inadequate due to various causes including multipath and signal blockage indoors, or where acquiring a satellite fix would take too long. 

The client querries a databse which holds geographical coordinates related to Access Points with the APs it sees in range. This data is collected using wardriving techniques, or more recently by crowdsourcing it with the actual clients. Apple Inc, along with Google, hold the two biggest databases of this kind.
